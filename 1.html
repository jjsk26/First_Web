    <h2>HTML란 무엇인가</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of web pages. 
    HTML uses a set of tags and attributes to define the elements and their attributes within a web page.
    HTML documents consist of a series of elements, which are enclosed in opening and closing tags. Tags are represented by angle brackets, and they surround the content they are applied to. For example, the tag is used to define a paragraph, and the text within the opening and closing tags represents the content of that paragraph.
    HTML allows you to structure your content by using various elements such as headings, paragraphs , lists or, and more. You can also include images, links, tables, forms, and multimedia elements within your HTML documents.
    Attributes provide additional information about an element and are specified within the opening tag. For instance, the tag is used to create a hyperlink, and it requires the "href" attribute to specify the destination URL.
    HTML is a key component of web development, as it forms the foundation for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, which can then be styled and enhanced using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and made interactive with JavaScript.
    Overall, HTML is a markup language that allows you to define the structure and content of web pages, making it possible to display information and create a rich user experience on the internet.</p>
